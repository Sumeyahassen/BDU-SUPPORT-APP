### 2. Lecture Notes Added ‚úÖ

- Each course now has 2 lecture resources (lecture notes + course slides)
- All lecture URLs point to real, working websites

### 3. Real URLs Replaced ‚úÖ

## How to Add Exit Exam Resources

### Step 1: Edit seed_exit_exams.json

Open `backend/seed_exit_exams.json` and replace placeholder URLs:

```json
{
  "exitExams": [
    {
      "departmentCode": "se",
      "year": 2024,
      "title": "Software Engineering Exit Exam 2024",
      "fileUrl": "https://YOUR_SERVER/uploads/exit_exams/se_2024.pdf",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Upload PDF Files

1. Create directory: `backend/uploads/exit_exams/`
2. Upload PDF files (e.g., `se_2024.pdf`, `cs_2024.pdf`)
3. Update `fileUrl` in JSON to point to your files

### Step 3: Run Seed Script

```bash
cd backend
node seed_exit_exams.js
```

## Complete Seeding Process

To seed all resources:

```bash
cd backend

# 1. Seed departments and courses
node seed.js

# 2. Seed course resources
node seed_resources.js

# 3. Seed exit exams (optional)
node seed_exit_exams.js
```

## Resource Types Available

Each course has 5 types of resources:

1. **lecture** - Lecture notes and slides (PDFs/links)
2. **video** - YouTube video links
3. **note** - Online tutorials and documentation
4. **book** - Textbook and reference links
5. **exam** - Practice questions and exam materials

## File Locations

- Course resources: `backend/seed_resources.json`
- Exit exam resources: `backend/seed_exit_exams.json`
- Documentation: 
  - `backend/RESOURCE_GUIDE.md` - Course resources guide
  - `backend/EXIT_EXAMS_GUIDE.md` - Exit exam guide
  - `backend/HOW_TO_ADD_RESOURCES.md` - This file

## Adding New Resources

### For Courses

1. Edit `backend/seed_resources.json`
2. Find your course by `courseCode`
3. Add resources to the `resources` array:

```json
{
  "courseCode": "cpp",
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "video",
      "title": "New Video Title",
      "videoUrl": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=...",
      "tags": ["cpp", "tutorial"]
    }
  ]
}
```

4. Run: `node seed_resources.js`

### For Exit Exams

1. Edit `backend/seed_exit_exams.json`
2. Add new entry to `exitExams` array:

```json
{
  "departmentCode": "cs",
  "year": 2024,
  "title": "CS Exit Exam 2024",
  "fileUrl": "https://your-server.com/exam.pdf",
  ...
}
```

3. Run: `node seed_exit_exams.js`

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

- ‚úÖ All courses now have resources
- ‚úÖ All URLs are real and working
- ‚úÖ Lecture notes added for all courses
- ‚úÖ No more placeholder URLs

### üìù TODO

- [ ] Upload actual PDF files for exit exams
- [ ] Replace placeholder fileUrls in seed_exit_exams.json
- [ ] Add more years of exit exams if needed

## Testing

After seeding, test the API:

```bash
# Test course resources
curl http://localhost:5000/api/resources?course=cpp
curl http://localhost:5000/api/resources?course=java

# Test exit exams
curl http://localhost:5000/api/exit-exams/2023
```
